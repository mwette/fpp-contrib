# fpp-contrib

This repo provides utilities which I've put together in my interest
in digging through [F-prime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) and 
[FPP](https://github.com/nasa/fpp).

## pgfprime.tex and demo1.tex
pgf (or tikz) figures to draw causal ports, called fingers and buttons

## nx-fpp

A parser for FPP. The prefix `nx` means (not exactly).  However, we
believe the current parser is mostly faithful to the FPP spec.  It 
currently does not handle multiple post-annotations.
